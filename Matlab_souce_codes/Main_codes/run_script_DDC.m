% If you have any questions please contact me at cbohrer1@jhmi.edu
% Really just send me an email!!

% This is a program which will correct for the blinking of a FP or dye
% without the use of any inputs other than the data iself. Well it does
% need two, the frame difference at which the true pairwise distributions
% are obtained and the resolution of the SMLM.

%I am modifying so that it shows which localizations are linked into
%trajectories. This is different than that which was in the origonal code!
%CHB -2020

% If you used different imaging
% conditions or did anything different accross the different images they
% should be imaged separatly.

%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%!!!!!!!!Make sure the localizations are in nm!!!!!!!!!!!!
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

% Please make sure the data is stored in a cell with the name
% LocalizationsFinal and the frame information in the cell Frame_Information

% See the USER GUIDE for an example on how to use this code.

% First clear the workspace.

% Set to 1 if using a cluster to analyze the data. You will need to modify
% the script 'Run_cluster.m' depending upon your particular case.
cluster=0;

% If you want to investigate how simulated data performs you can look at the
% relative score. Otherwise we create a blank array, as the only way you can
% know the true localizations is with simulation data.

Photons={};%See User guide
Photons{1}=[];
% This will adjust your path based off of whether you are using a cluster or
% not. You may need to adjust the names of some strings in the following if
% you are using a cluster. It is very intuative, if not just leave it alone

    if min(size(LocalizationsFinal{sdfv}))<3
        LocalizationsFinal{sdfv}(:,3)=LocalizationsFinal{sdfv}(:,2)*0;
    end
end

% The program will save out the data after analysis.
% It will have the following name and date added to the name.
String=['Analyzed_Time',datestr((datetime('today'))),'_',filename];

%These arrays will save the results! They will provide the final cordinates
%of the images.
Final_Loc_Blinking_Corrected={};%This is the set that contains the localizations that are considered the real localizations
Final_Frame_Blinking_Corrected={};%and their frames
Trajectory_of_Localizations={};%This will store the trajectoy of the particular localiztion in the origonal order

%% Determining the Blinking Distribution
% This is the first step of DDC, where the blinking distribution is actually
% determined. This step will determine P_{blink} (See Supporting material)

% Here we determine the probability distribution that a molecule will blink
% a certain distance away. It is calculated by compairing the pairwise
% distance distributions from all cells, with the true distributions from all cells.

% Note here all of the images within the LocalizationFinal structure are
% supposed to have the same resolution. If you used different imaging
% conditions or did anything different accross the different images they
% should be analyzed separatly.

timer=3600*.2;%The amount of time to spend investigating each image before saving output.

% Here is some information that is used by DDC. You do not need to worry
% about the specifics of these cells. Though, if you do want to understand
% them you can see the USER GUIDE.

Constantf2={}; % This is known as kappa2(frame) within the supporting material

Lik={}; % The likelihood at that step
RelScore={}; % The image error if the true localizations are known (assuming 40nm resolution for the SMLM data)
Numb_of_Loc={}; % The number of localizations at each step of the MCMC approach for each image
Prob_dists={}; % The probability distributions for each image used to calculate the likelihood, so that we do not need to calculate them each time.
